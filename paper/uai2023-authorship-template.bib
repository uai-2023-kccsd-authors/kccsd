    abstract = {This is the authorship bibfile for your accepted paper. The paper code `von-o-lopez_969' should be replaced with the one for your paper. This bibfile should contain the title of your paper in sentence case (but without any other change from the paper). It should also contain the author list in BibTeX format as above, so in ‘Lastnames, Firstnames’ format (same authors and order as in the submitted version, as you are not allowed to change them). For accented characters, use LaTeX escaped codes, not UTF-8. Finally, you should copy your paper's abstract here, again using LaTeX escaped codes, not UTF-8. Of course, also the constraints about full citations (if any), no math, and no abbreviations carry over from the paper.}
